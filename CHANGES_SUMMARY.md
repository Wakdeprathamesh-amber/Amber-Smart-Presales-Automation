# Smart Presales System - Recent Changes

## 1. Phone Number Validation

We've added robust phone number validation to ensure only correctly formatted phone numbers are entered:

- Added visual cues with a "+" prefix in the input field
- Added pattern validation for 10-15 digit numbers
- Improved error messages for invalid phone numbers
- Automatically formats numbers for the Vapi API (ensuring they start with "+")
- Added clear guidance text explaining the required format

## 2. Manual Call Initiation Only

We've modified the system to only initiate calls when explicitly requested from the dashboard:

- Updated `get_pending_leads()` with an `only_retry=True` parameter
- Modified the call orchestrator to only process retry leads automatically
- New leads will only be called when the "Call" button is clicked in the dashboard
- Retry logic still works automatically for missed calls

## 3. Post-Call Analysis Flow

We've verified and enhanced the post-call analysis flow:

- Created a test script (`test_webhook.py`) to simulate Vapi webhook events
- Ensured proper handling of all webhook events:
  - Call status updates (answered, missed, ended)
  - End-of-call reports with AI analysis
- Verified structured data extraction and display in the UI
- Added detailed call history view in the lead details modal

## How to Test

### Phone Number Validation
1. Open the dashboard at http://localhost:5001
2. Click "Add Lead"
3. Try entering invalid phone numbers to see validation in action
4. Enter a valid number with country code (e.g., 919876543210)

### Manual Call Initiation
1. Add a new lead through the dashboard
2. Observe that the lead appears with "pending" status
3. Verify that the orchestrator doesn't automatically call it
4. Click the "Call" button to manually initiate a call

### Post-Call Analysis Flow
1. Ensure the server is running
2. Use the test script to simulate webhook events:
   ```
   python test_webhook.py 0 full
   ```
3. Check the dashboard to see the lead updated with:
   - Call status changed to "completed"
   - Summary text from the AI analysis
   - Success status (Qualified, Potential, or Not Qualified)
   - Structured data extracted from the conversation

## Next Steps

1. **Production Deployment**: Consider deploying the system to a production environment
2. **WhatsApp Integration**: Add WhatsApp follow-up for missed calls
3. **Email Integration**: Add email follow-up for missed calls
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Create more detailed analytics and reporting
