# 🔍 LangFuse Observability - Enhanced Integration

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **IMPROVED - Full Details Now Visible**

---

## 🎯 Problem Identified

**Issue**: Calls show up in LangFuse dashboard, but missing details:
- ❌ Transcript not visible
- ❌ Call duration not shown
- ❌ Analysis details incomplete
- ❌ Recording URL not linked
- ❌ Timestamps not in IST

**Root Cause**: 
- LangFuse logging was basic (only trace creation)
- Transcript logged separately (not attached to trace)
- Call metadata not included
- Multiple disconnected events instead of unified trace

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **1. Unified Trace per Lead** 🔗
**Before**: Each event created separate trace
**After**: All events for a lead go into ONE trace using `lead_uuid` as trace ID

```python
# Now all events use the same trace ID
trace = langfuse.trace(
    id=lead_uuid,  # ✅ Same ID for all events
    name="lead_call_journey",
    user_id=lead_uuid
)
```

**Result**: Complete call journey visible in one place!

### **2. Enhanced Call Analysis Logging** 📊
**Before**: Only summary and status
**After**: Complete analysis with all metadata

```python
log_call_analysis(
    lead_uuid=lead_uuid,
    summary=summary,
    success_status=success_status,
    structured_data=parsed_data,
    call_id=call_id,
    transcript=transcript_text,        # ✅ NEW
    call_duration=call_duration,       # ✅ NEW
    recording_url=recording_url        # ✅ NEW
)
```

**What's Now Visible**:
- ✅ Full transcript (first 1000 chars in event)
- ✅ Call duration (in metadata + as score)
- ✅ Recording URL (clickable link)
- ✅ Structured data (country, university, course, etc.)
- ✅ IST timestamps throughout

### **3. Call Metrics as Scores** 📈
**Before**: No quantitative metrics
**After**: Automatic scoring for analytics

```python
# Lead qualification score
trace.score(
    name="lead_qualification",
    value=1.0,  # Qualified=1.0, Potential=0.7, Not Qualified=0.3
    comment=f"Status: {success_status}"
)

# Call duration score
trace.score(
    name="call_duration",
    value=0.5,  # Normalized 0-1 (0-600 seconds)
    comment=f"{call_duration} seconds"
)
```

**Result**: Can now analyze call quality trends!

### **4. Transcript as Event** 📝
**Before**: Transcript logged as separate message
**After**: Transcript attached to main trace as event

```python
trace.event(
    name="call_transcript",
    input={"transcript": transcript[:1000]},
    metadata={
        "full_length": len(transcript),
        "call_id": call_id,
        "timestamp": get_ist_timestamp()
    }
)
```

**Result**: Transcript visible in trace timeline!

### **5. IST Timestamps** ⏰
**Before**: UTC timestamps (confusing)
**After**: All timestamps in IST

```python
"timestamp": get_ist_timestamp()  # ✅ IST everywhere
```

**Result**: Correct Indian time in all LangFuse events!

## 🔧 Configuration Check

Ensure these environment variables are set:

```bash
# In .env and Render
ENABLE_OBSERVABILITY=true
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-...
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-...
LANGFUSE_HOST=https://us.cloud.langfuse.com
LANGFUSE_DEBUG=false
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Traces still empty**
**Check**:
1. Verify `LANGFUSE_HOST=https://us.cloud.langfuse.com` (US region)
2. Check Render logs for LangFuse errors
3. Ensure `langfuse.flush()` is called

**Fix**: Already implemented - all flush() calls in place

### **Issue: Transcript not showing**
**Check**:
1. Verify Vapi returns transcript in webhook
2. Check `self.vapi_client` is initialized
3. Look for `[CallReport] Transcript stored` in logs

**Fix**: Already implemented - transcript fetched and logged

### **Issue: Recording URL missing**
**Check**:
1. Verify Vapi includes `artifact.recordingUrl` in webhook
2. Check if recording is enabled in Vapi dashboard

**Fix**: Already implemented - recording_url extracted and logged

### **Issue: Timestamps wrong**
**Check**:
1. Verify all files use `get_ist_timestamp()`
2. Check `src/utils.py` exists

**Fix**: ✅ Already implemented - all files updated

---
